		"Comments": "I enjoyed Annihilation a lot, especially the first half of the book, where the expedition into Area X had just started and they were observing and investigating strange phenomena. The second half, while certainly entertaining and suspenseful as the story progressed, didn't have as much action as I would have liked. A significant portion of the book switches back and forth from the biologist's perspective, wandering through Area X, and her life prior to joining the mission. I didn't mind this, but every time she would go back to discussing some aspect of her earlier life, I always felt like I would rather be exploring more of the mystery of Area X, rather than uncovering some personal truth about herself or her husband. Overall, though, I think that both the story and the writing are above average.",
