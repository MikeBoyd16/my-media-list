The second half, while certainly entertaining and suspenseful as the story progressed, didn't have as much action as I would have liked. A significant portion of the book switches back and forth from the biologist's perspective, wandering through Area X, and her life prior to joining the mission. I didn't mind this, but every time she would go back to discussing some aspect of her earlier life, I always felt like I would rather be exploring more of the mystery of Area X, rather than uncovering some personal truth about herself or her husband. Overall, though, I think that both the story and the writing are above average.", "Media": "Book", "Status": "Finished - Completed", "Date Entered": "6.26.2018"}, "TT-Music-6.26.2018": {"Title": "TT", "Score": 9, "Type": "Song", "Source Type": "EP", "Source Name": "TWICEcoaster: LANE1", "Duration": "3:34", "Main Artist": "TWICE", "Featured Artists": "", "Record Label": "JYP Entertainment", "Songwriters": ["Sam Lewis", "Black Eyed Pilseung"], "Producers": "", "Year": "2016", "Genres": ["KPOP", "Electro-Pop"], "Media": "Music", "Date Entered": "6.26.2018"}, "Pillars of Eternity-Video Game-6.26.2018": {"Title": "Pillars of Eternity", "Score": 7, "Platform": "PC - Origin", "Hours Played": "7", "Campaign Finished?": "No", "Achievement Progress": "N/A", "Developers": "Obsidian Entertainment", "Publishers": "Paradox Interactive", "Year": "2015", "Genres": "Role-playing", "Tags": ["RPG", "Fantasy", "Story Rich", "cRPG", "Party-based RPG", "Crowdfunded", "Isometric"], "Comments": "Pillars of Eternity is a high quality game, but I don't think I'm a fan of the isometric cRPG style.", "Media": "Video Game", "Status": "Finished - Dropped", "Date Entered": "6.26.2018"}, "Like OOH-AHH-Music-6.27.2018": {"Title": "Like OOH-AHH", "Score": 5, "Type": "Song", "Source Type": "EP", "Source Name": "THE STORY BEGINS", "Duration": "3:35", "Main Artist": "TWICE", "Featured Artists": "", "Record Label": "JYP Entertainment", "Songwriters": ["Black Eyed Pilseung", "Sam Lewis"], "Producers": ["Black Eyed Pilseung", "Sam Lewis"], "Year": "2015", "Genres": "KPOP", "Media": "Music", "Date Entered": "6.27.2018"}, "Do It Again-Music-6.27.2018": {"Title": "Do It Again", "Score": 5, "Type": "Song", "Source Type": "EP", "Source Name": "THE STORY BEGINS", "Duration": "3:26", "Main Artist": "TWICE", "Featured Artists": "", "Record Label": "JYP Entertainment", "Songwriters": "J.Y.
